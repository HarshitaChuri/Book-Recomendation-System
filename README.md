# Book-Recomendation-System


This Book Recommendation System project allows users to search for books by keywords in the title, authors, or publisher. It utilizes a CSV dataset of books, leveraging pandas for data manipulation. The system displays detailed book information, including ratings, publication date, and more. The code is designed for easy execution and can be run directly to provide personalized book recommendations.
